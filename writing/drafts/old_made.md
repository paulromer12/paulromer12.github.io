MADE

Formula 1 is my favorite sport, not just for its thrilling competition and advanced technology but because it perfectly combines competition, sportsmanship, engineering, technology, strategy, teamwork, athleticism, and business.


I love learning about business and technology.


My journey began in finance at Fidelity, where I acquired valuable knowledge and licenses and developed an understanding of our customers' needs. This experience fueled my passion for technology as a means to enhance the overall client experience. As I contemplated the future of my career, I realized that while client service was a significant learning opportunity and one I'm grateful for, the prospect of enhancing the client experience through technology is what truly excited me. I see updates to our systems and get so excited. I tell my wife, who graciously listens. I dive in myself to learn more about how they work and use them so that I can help my team and our clients apply them.


From finance, it grew to a love of learning about the best entrepreneurs in history. The people who have shaped our world and improved everyone's lives. My favorite podcasts are Founders by David Senra and How to Take Over the World by Ben Wilson. Learning about successful entrepreneurs became a significant part of my journey. They inspired me to approach business analysis with the same creativity, courage, and grit that have shaped the world's most influential figures, leading me to prepare for a role as a business analyst.


Over the past two years, I've actively prepared for the role, taking courses in project management, data analytics, and Python. This preparation included a rewarding experience in the Amplify program. For six months, I collaborated with the User Experience Research team, leveraging my four years of customer-centric insights and knowledge about finance and Fidelity. I conducted an unmoderated research study.


I've applied to roles as a business analyst trying and got close recently, but ultimately wasn't the right fit... yet. I'm constantly considering my options and taking the feedback that I get to continue to grow.


As I considered how to continue my preparation, I decided to solidify my technical skills, which currently consist of what I've learned pursuing random interests over the last few years. Activities like building computers, learning how they work, intro to programming courses, the advent of code, google foo-bar, and bitcoin. This decision led me to open my GitHub account recently, which I created in 2016 when I started learning Python and created a mad lib as I learned about variables and input/output. Since then, I returned to programming a handful of times when something would pique my interest, or I'd want to know how something works. I've focused on solidifying my technical skills by going back to school and getting a degree in software development, which I am currently enrolled in.


I was ignorant when I started at Fidelity. I grew up in a small town and didn't think about the people building the things I used daily. I didn't even consider that there are teams of people with technical skills building the software that makes my life better and excites me every day. Let alone that I could be one of those people. I want to provide a good life for my family, help others, and work for a great company on projects that align with my interest in business and technology.


I seek the MADE opportunity to continue learning, enhancing my technical skills, building my business acumen, leveraging my customer-centric experiences on the team, creating tools that enrich lives, helping individuals achieve their goals, and furthering Fidelity's business. I am excited about being part of a dynamic team, much like those F1 teams I admire, where continuous improvement, strategic thinking, and technical excellence are not just goals but a way of life.
