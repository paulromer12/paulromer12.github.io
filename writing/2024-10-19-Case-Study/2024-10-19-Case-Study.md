The final project for CSD310 was a group project where we were given a case study for a business that wanted to digitize. We had to make a lot of assumptions.

First:
- We started by reviewing the case study with a short description of the business and it's goals.
- Then we created business rules
- Turned those business rules into the following ERD

Second: We created an SQL script to intialize the MySQL database, and fill it with some dummy data.

Third: We created a python script to generate 3 example reports that could be used by the business.

Fourth: We created a PowerPoint with an overview of the project, the reports, and the 2 scripts that generate everything. Check out the code via the link to the repo at the top of this post.
