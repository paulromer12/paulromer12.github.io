title:  "Replit 100 Days of Code - Python"
---

Today marks the completion of Replit's 100 Days of Code challenge. 

Over the past few years, I've dabbled in programming. I've explored Harvard's CS50 class, watched countless YouTube videos/twitch streams (Engineering Man, ThePrimeagen, georgehotz, John Hammond, Fireship, Computerphile, ect.), started various courses, learned git, and reviewed the basics multiple times. Each time I returned to programming, it was driven by my curiosity and fascination with understanding how to really use computers, but I lacked a concrete goal. While I acquired some knowledge each time, such as utilizing while loops for interest calculations or creating CLI madlibs, I never felt I possessed the skills needed to do any real projects.

# Motivation
This time, I was commited. Why? Because I'm activally applying to become a Business Analyst. I seek a job that is engaging and enables me to provide more for my family.

# My Experience
The course was an incredible experience. The initial 50 days flew by since I had previously studied many fundamental programming concepts. They were a great refresher. However, the latter half of the challenge truly rewarded me as I applied those concepts practically. Given that my immediate goal isn't to become a full-fledged developer, I focused on comprehending the underlying processes, ensuring that I grasped the big picture before diving into the code and examining its individual components. I didn't prioritize memorizing all the syntax because ChatGPT, lol. Although I didn't utilize it for every project, whenever I did, I made sure to carefully review the code it generated to ensure I understood what it was doing and that it met the requirements of that day in the way it was taught.

This approach allowed me to practice problem-solving, prompting, and project management, while simultaneously producing valuable software that adhered to the requirements outlined in each lesson. These are precisely the skills I need for my next career advancement.

I'm thrilled to continue my learning journey, actively seeking opportunities to apply these newfound abilities in both my professional and personal life.

Next on the agenda: Demonstrating Data Analytics.
